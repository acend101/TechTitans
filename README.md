## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Tech Titans]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Chris P D] - [TEC]
- Member 2: [Anto Punnoose] - [TEC]

### Project Description
[A website designed to count the number of potholes in the road using AI]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[There are so many potholes in kerala roads, so to get a approximate number of potholes in the road.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We train an AI to count the number potholes in a road. we upload a video of the road from start to end and the AI detects the number of potholes. ]
